Feature: Offers, orders and favourites backlog
  As a returning user
  I want visibility over promotions, past orders and saved favourites
  So that loyalty journeys remain intact

  # Planned scenarios (commented out intentionally)

  # @todo @offers Scenario: Offers section shows the correct number of deals
  #   Then the offers carousel should list every available promotion with working links
  #
  # @todo @orders Scenario: Orders history loads for accounts with existing orders
  #   Given I am logged in as "existing_orders_user"
  #   Then the Orders tab should display the past purchases table
  #
  # @todo @favorites_persist Scenario: Favourites persist after reload
  #   Given I mark multiple products as favourites
  #   When I refresh the page or re-login
  #   Then the same items should remain in the favourites section
