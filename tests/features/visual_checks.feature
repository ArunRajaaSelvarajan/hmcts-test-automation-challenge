Feature: Visual and UX validation backlog
  As a quality engineer
  I want to ensure shared components render correctly on every page
  So that users always see complete content

  # Planned scenarios (kept as comments until automated)

  # @todo @footer Scenario: Footer links are consistent across pages
  #   Then Trademark, Privacy Policy, Read More and Subscribe to Newsletter links should work
  #   And the delivery illustration should be visible
  #
  # @todo @images Scenario: Placeholder images are replaced with loaded images
  #   Given I log in as "image_not_loading_user"
  #   Then no product card should fall back to a placeholder image
